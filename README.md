## About the Project

The essence of De La Salle University's campus culture predominantly centers around student organizations. Aspiring student leaders play a pivotal role in shaping the campus life, fostering academic leadership, and facilitating networking opportunities. However, despite the abundance of extracurricular activities, there exists a need for a centralized and dynamic platform that fosters seamless communication and collaboration among student organizations. As a result, student organizations utilize social media, primarily Facebook, as means of achieving this purpose. 

As we recognize the challenges faced by student leaders in efficiently advertising events, seeking partnerships, and showcasing their organizational roles, we are proposing our Forum Web Application which aims to address this gap. As inspired by the spirit of DLSU's energetic campus life, our platform provides a specialized avenue for student leaders to share information about events, request collaborations, and personalize their profiles with badges and positions. 

This application not only streamlines organizational communication but also creates a community hub tailored to the unique needs of students engaged in diverse extracurricular responsibilities, offering a digital space akin to a small-scale LinkedIn for the university's dynamic student body.
